> Real estate property offer tracking app

Currently this is just a re-implementation of the FRONTEND folder here:
https://github.com/ArturGrigio/offer-tracker

I did this simply as a way to get familiar with Vue and the Vue CLI.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
